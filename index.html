    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Morlocks Studio is a Non-official LLC Company, that intends to be official. The team is hoping to make games that stray off from the common/popular trend. To come up with new and fresh innovative ideas, instead of the same why not new? So that's how Morlock Studios came to life. Since the beginning when I started this team. I really wanted to try the impossible that no developer ever dares to attempt. Which is coming up with new stories, new worlds and ideas. Bringing tales and Entertainment to show our vision to the world to bring happiness and inspiration to the audience and players out there to leave a meaningful impact in their hearts and mind. By leaving a legacy for generations to come.</p>
